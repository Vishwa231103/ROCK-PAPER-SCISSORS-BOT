# ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS-BOT
The goal was to create a Rock-Paper-Scissors game where a human player competes against various AI bots, each using a unique strategy. The project includes a user-friendly GUI made with Pygame and avoids using external image files to ensure compatibility with lightweight environments like Notepad.
